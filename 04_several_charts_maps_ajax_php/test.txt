I want to download the latest season of Friends, how can i do that?

Isn’t that illlegal?

I’m afraid I don’t. I’d prefer another way. On a side note: what is your favourite character in Friends and why?

Don’t think to much, just say the first thing that comes up to mind.

Okay

No imagine you are really talking to a customer and he says: 

“I have sent some 5 mails and I havent received any reply can u please let me know if you have received”

You don’t know anything about that but you need to give an answer. How would you politely answer him?
